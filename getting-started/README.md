# Getting Started

These docs are a comprehensive guide to the Strike protocol, based on the Strike Whitepaper [\(Feb 2021\)](https://strike.org/documents/Strike.Whitepaper.pdf). The protocol is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/strike-finance/strike-protocol) and maintained by the community.

Please join the \#development room in the Strike community [Discord](https://discord.gg/874ntdw) server; our team, and members of the community, look forward to helping you build an application on top of Strike. Your questions help us improve, so please don't hesitate to ask if you can't find what you are looking for here.
