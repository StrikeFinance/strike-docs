# Get Actions

Gets the actions of a selected proposal. Pass a proposal ID and get the targets, values, signatures and calldatas of that proposal.

**Governor Alpha**

```text
function getActions(uint proposalId) returns (uint proposalId) public view returns (address[] memory targets, uint[] memory values, string[] memory signatures, bytes[] memory calldatas)
```

* `proposalId`: ID of a proposal in which to get its actions.
* `RETURN`: Reverts if the proposal ID is invalid. If successful, the following 4 references are returned. 1. Array of addresses of contracts the proposal calls. 2. Array of unsigned integers the proposal uses as values. 3. Array of strings of the proposalâ€™s signatures. 4. Array of calldata bytes of the proposal.

**Solidity**

```text
GovernorAlpha gov = GovernorAlpha(0x123...); // contract address
uint proposalId = 123;
(address[] memory targets, uint[] memory values, string[] memory signatures, bytes[] memory calldatas) = gov.getActions(proposalId);
```

**Web3 1.2.6**

```javascript
const {0: targets, 1: values, 2: signatures, 3: calldatas} = gov.methods.getActions(proposalId).call();
```
