# Close Factor

The percent, ranging from 0% to 100%, of a liquidatable account's borrow that can be repaid in a single liquidate transaction. If a user has multiple borrowed assets, the closeFactor applies to any single borrowed asset, not the aggregated value of a userâ€™s outstanding borrowing.

function closeFactorMantissa() view returns (uint)
```

* `RETURN`: The closeFactor, scaled by 1e18, is multiplied by an outstanding borrow balance to determine how much could be closed.

Comptroller troll = Comptroller(0xABCD...);
uint closeFactor = troll.closeFactorMantissa();
